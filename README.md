I'm a passionate developer who loves to explore new frameworks and libraries, especially in the frontend world. My main focus is on frontend development, but I'm equally confident when working with backend technologies. Whether itâ€™s working solo or collaborating within a team, I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously pushing myself to learn more.
