I'm a passionate developer who loves to explore new frameworks and libraries, especially in the frontend world. My main focus is on **frontend development**, but I'm equally confident when working with **backend technologies**. Whether itâ€™s working solo or collaborating within a team, I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously pushing myself to learn more.
